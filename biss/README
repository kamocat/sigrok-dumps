BISS C / Renishaw Encoder
--------------------------------------------------------

This is a set of example captures of unidirectional BISS
communication with a Renishaw Resolute absolute encoder.

The BISS adapter used is an MB5U USB adapter from IC-Haus.

Although the encoder supports 32k updates per second, I
was not able to get the MB5U to exceed 70 updates per second.

Logic analzyer setup
---------------------

The differential signal was converted using RS422 transcivers
on the MO+/- and SLO+/- lines.

The logic analyzer was a generic fx2lafw device at 24MHz

    Channels  Signal
    ------------------------
    1         MO  (Clock)
    3         SLO (Data)


All samples were captured with Pulseview using a sample rate of 24MHz and a sample length of 1M

The sigrok command might be
    sigrok-cli --driver fx2lafw --config samplerate=24m --samples 1m  
               -c '1=MA,3=SLO' \
               -o renishaw_biss_1MHz.sr

renishaw_biss_250kHz.sr
--------------------

The MB5U was configured for 250kHz clock rate.

renishaw_biss_1MHz.sr
--------------------

The MB5U was configured for 1MHz clock rate.

renishaw_biss_2MHz.sr
--------------------

The MB5U was configured for 2MHz clock rate.

renishaw_biss_5MHz.sr
--------------------

The MB5U was configured for 5MHz clock rate.

renishaw_biss_10MHz.sr
--------------------

The MB5U was configured for 10MHz clock rate.
